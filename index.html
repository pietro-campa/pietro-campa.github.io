              <p>My research focuses on labor economics, education, and intergenerational mobility. I am particularly interested in how early life circumstances influence access to opportunities, with a special emphasis on the role of social networks in shaping labor market outcomes. <br>
              I will complete my Ph.D. in Economics at the University of Geneva in September 2025, under the supervision of Giacomo De Giorgi and Robert Frederic Nicoud. </p>

            <h2><b>"No Kid is an Island: Peer Effects and Intergenerational Mobility"</b></h2>
            <p>Economic inequalities persist from one generation to the next. How much of this transmission is due to differences in peer exposure? Exploiting within school across cohort exogenous variation in schoolmates' parental background among Danish high school students, I show that a $1 increase in average schoolmates' parental earnings results in a $0.08 increase in adult earnings. This effect is as large as 30% of the parent-child correlation in earnings. I find that former schoolmates are connected on labor market networks: they join their peers' firms and leverage school connections as outside options to secure higher wages, effectively benefiting from advantages inherited by their peers from their parents. </p><br>

We establish that inherited histories significantly positively affect initial scores, which in turn are very persistent. Inherited histories only affect outcomes through initial credit scores, which then have significant persistent effects on credit use and access, such as having a mortgage. Our results are consistent with mechanisms of self-fulfilling liquidity traps: low credit scores mean lack of access to credit, reinforcing low credit scores. Future research should address the contribution of such mechanisms to wealth inequality."

Using Danish administrative data, we document grandparental effects on children’s life-time incomes other than grandparents’ influence on parental human capital. These results call for broadening the scope of established models of intergenerational mobility and human capital accumulation within the family which consider only two generations. Finally, we propose mass-layoffs as a potential source of exogenous variation in retirement time to estimate the causal impact of grandparental interactions on their grandkids."
