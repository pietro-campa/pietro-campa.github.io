              <p>As an applied microeconomist, my research centers on the intergenerational transmission of inequalities. I am particularly interested in the effects of sorting across neighborhoods and schools, and how early interactions shape access to opportunities through educational outcomes and social networks within the labor market. <br>

            <h2><b>"No Kid is an Island: Peer Effects and Intergenerational Mobility"</b></h2>
            <p>This paper explores the relevance of peer effects on intergenerational mobility by examining how exogenous exposure to high school peers’ from higher-earning families influences access to opportunities. Using comprehensive administrative data from Denmark, I show that a one standard deviation increase in average schoolmates’ parental earnings leads to a 2% increase in lifetime earnings. Leveraging variation in former schoolmates’ initial coworkers’ wage trajectories, I identify endogenous peer affects accounting for 30% of the exposure effect via former schoolmates acting as weak ties on the labor market. This paper highlights the role of social interactions in reinforcing the persistence of economic outcomes from one generation to the next.</p><br>

We establish that inherited histories significantly positively affect initial scores, which in turn are very persistent. Inherited histories only affect outcomes through initial credit scores, which then have significant persistent effects on credit use and access, such as having a mortgage. Our results are consistent with mechanisms of self-fulfilling liquidity traps: low credit scores mean lack of access to credit, reinforcing low credit scores. Future research should address the contribution of such mechanisms to wealth inequality."

Using Danish administrative data, we document grandparental effects on children’s life-time incomes other than grandparents’ influence on parental human capital. These results call for broadening the scope of established models of intergenerational mobility and human capital accumulation within the family which consider only two generations. Finally, we propose mass-layoffs as a potential source of exogenous variation in retirement time to estimate the causal impact of grandparental interactions on their grandkids."
