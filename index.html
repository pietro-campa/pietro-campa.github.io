                <p>
                    Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at University of Geneva. I am an applied microeconomist interested in intergenerational transmission of inequality. In my work I study how initial conditions shape individuals’ access to opportunities. I have a specific interest in why families sort across different neighborhoods and what are the implications of this choice for their children. I like maps and models.

            <p>
                I explore how access to opportunities is related to family background and residential sorting. Leveraging on rich administrative data from Denmark, I identify the role played by adults outside the family in intergenerational mobility. Exploiting plausibly exogenous variation across cohorts within the same school, I estimate the marginal effect of exposure to schoolmates’ parents. My results suggest that the effect of adults outside the family on children’s opportunities (lifetime earnings) is as large as 18% of the correlation in earnings between children and parents. Finally, I develop a dynastic life-cycle discrete choice model where parents choose their location anticipating the neighborhood effect on their potential off-spring. The model is designed to (i) determine the relevance of neighborhood effects for intergenerational mobility (ii) disentangle different mechanisms (access to education vs local spillovers in productivity) underlying such effects.            </p>

                We study how inheriting parents’ credit histories affects credit scores and access to credit of young individuals entering the credit market, and their subsequent experiences in the credit market. First, having an inherited credit history significantly positively affects credit scores at entry. Second, initial credit scores are very persistent. Third, inherited credit histories only affect outcomes through the initial credit score distribution. Finally, initial credit scores have significant persistent effects on credit use and access, such as having a mortgage or credit card penetration and utilization rate. Our results point to the importance of initial conditions in credit markets and are consistent with mechanisms based on multiplicity of equilibria and self-fulfilling liquidity traps in which lack of access to credit due to low credit scores re-affirms the low credit score ranking of an individual.            </p>
